1. inorderTraversal
/// tow nested loop. 1.first push all the left ele in stack. 2.pop one by one store in al 3. move right;

2. preorderTraversal
/// preorder follows root, left, right. since its stack we are using we need to pish right first and then left

3. postOrderTraverasl
 //1 puhs root in fir Stack
 //2 loop while fir is not empty()
        //1. pop a node from fir and move to second
        //2. if popped node has children push into first
 //3 pirnt contents of second stack.

4. Kth Smallest Element In BSTree
///  Do inorderTraversal , store in AL, return al.get(K-1)

5. Right View Of Binary Tree
///  Do level order and pop the items from q till the size of previous level and add the last node in AL.

6. Reverse Level Order
/// Do level order but store every ele in stacks, 2. pop all ele from stack and add to AL, return AL.
