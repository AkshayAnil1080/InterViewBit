//// need to recur under a for loop
// 1. pass a AL<AL<int>>res, A, Al<int>curr into fun
// 2. add A[i] to curr , need to remove A[i] from and add next to curr.
// but cannot change the original A, as havet to itr for i=0; i<A>size()l
// Adup.remove(i);  // copy the original A in Adup and pass Adup to recur.
// 3. After reccursion // emptying the same curr when return is reached via BC
